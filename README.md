# PHP OOP Examples

This repository collects small PHP scripts that demonstrate core object-oriented concepts.

## Files

- [__constructor.php](__constructor.php): illustrates how constructors set up initial state for class instances.
- [__destructor.php](__destructor.php): shows PHP destructors releasing resources when objects go out of scope.
- [abstrack.php](abstrack.php): defines an abstract [`Car::class`](abstrack.php) with concrete behavior in [`AudiCar::class`](abstrack.php).
- [class_object.php](class_object.php): covers creating objects, accessing properties, and calling methods.
- [constant.php](constant.php): demonstrates class constants and accessing them via the scope resolution operator.
- [inheritance.php](inheritance.php): provides an example of extending a parent class and overriding functionality.
- [practice_class_task.php](practice_class_task.php): contains assorted exercises combining constructors, methods, and inheritance.

## Running the examples

From your PHP-enabled environment, execute a script directly, e.g.:

```bash
php abstrack.php
```

Each file outputs context-specific information to illustrate the concept it demonstrates.
